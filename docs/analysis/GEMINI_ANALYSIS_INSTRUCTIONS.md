## Analysis Output Format

For each framework, create a structured analysis document:

### FastMCP 2.0 Analysis
```markdown
# FastMCP 2.0 Comprehensive Analysis

## Executive Summary
- 2-3 sentences on overall assessment
- Key strengths and weaknesses
- Fit for fastmango integration

## Architecture Analysis
[Detailed findings for each category above]

## Code Examples
[Key patterns with code snippets]

## Django Integration Assessment
[Specific evaluation for fastmango compatibility]

## Recommendations
[Specific recommendations for fastmango]
```

### Anthropic MCP SDK Analysis
```markdown
# Anthropic MCP Python SDK Comprehensive Analysis

[Same structure as above]
```

## Specific Analysis Instructions

### 1. Read Key Files First
Start with these files to understand each framework:

**FastMCP 2.0:**
- `README.md` - Overview and examples
- `src/fastmcp/__init__.py` - Main exports
- `src/fastmcp/server/__init__.py` - Server implementation
- `examples/` - Usage patterns
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies and project structure

**Anthropic MCP SDK:**
- `README.md` - Official documentation
- `src/mcp/__init__.py` - Main exports  
- `src/mcp/server/` - Server implementation
- `examples/` - Official examples
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies

### 2. Focus Areas for fastmango Integration

Pay special attention to:
- **Decorator patterns** for tools/resources (similar to Django views)
- **Configuration systems** (settings.py equivalent)
- **Auto-discovery mechanisms** (like Django apps)
- **CLI tooling** (manage.py equivalent)
- **Testing patterns** (Django test integration)
- **Production deployment** (WSGI/ASGI equivalents)

### 3. Comparison Points

Create direct comparisons on:
- **Boilerplate required** for basic server
- **Learning curve** for Django developers
- **Type safety** and validation approaches
- **Production readiness** features
- **Community and ecosystem** size
- **Integration complexity** with Django patterns

## Deliverables

Please provide:

1. **FastMCP 2.0 Analysis Document** (`FASTMCP_2_ANALYSIS.md`)
2. **Anthropic MCP SDK Analysis Document** (`ANTHROPIC_MCP_ANALYSIS.md`)
3. **Comparative Analysis** (`FRAMEWORK_COMPARISON.md`)
4. **fastmango Integration Recommendations** (`FASTMANGO_MCP_STRATEGY.md`)

## Analysis Depth Guidelines

- **High Priority**: Architecture, API design, Django integration potential
- **Medium Priority**: Advanced features, production capabilities  
- **Low Priority**: Internal implementation details, edge cases

## Questions to Answer

After analysis, these should be answerable:

1. Which framework aligns better with fastmango's Django-like philosophy?
2. Which provides better developer experience for Django developers?
3. Which has better long-term sustainability?
4. Which would require less adaptation work for fastmango integration?
5. Is there potential for a hybrid approach using both?

## Timeline

Please complete analysis in this order:
1. FastMCP 2.0 (comprehensive)
2. Anthropic MCP SDK (comprehensive)
3. Direct comparison
4. fastmango strategy recommendations
