# MCP Framework Analysis

Analysis of existing MCP frameworks to inform fjango's MCP integration strategy.

## Frameworks Under Analysis

### 1. FastMCP 2.0 (Independent)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp
- **Status**: Active development, independent from Anthropic
- **Focus**: Comprehensive MCP toolkit with advanced features

### 2. Anthropic MCP Python SDK (Official)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk
- **Status**: Official Anthropic SDK, includes FastMCP 1.0
- **Focus**: Core MCP protocol implementation

## Analysis Goals

1. **Architecture Comparison**: How do they structure MCP server development?
2. **Feature Completeness**: What features does each provide?
3. **Developer Experience**: Which approach offers better DX?
4. **Integration Potential**: Which would work better with fjango's Django-like patterns?
5. **Long-term Strategy**: Which has better alignment with fjango's vision?

## Decision Framework

| Criteria | Weight | FastMCP 2.0 | Anthropic SDK | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Feature Richness | 25% | TBD | TBD | |
| Django Compatibility | 30% | TBD | TBD | |
| Long-term Support | 25% | TBD | TBD | |
| Community/Ecosystem | 20% | TBD | TBD | |

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Clone and analyze both codebases
- **Phase 2**: Create comparison document
- **Phase 3**: Recommend integration strategy for fjango
