# MCP Frameworks: Comparative Analysis

This document provides a direct comparison between FastMCP 2.0 and the Anthropic MCP Python SDK to inform the integration strategy for the fjango framework.

## At a Glance

| Feature / Philosophy        | FastMCP 2.0 (Standalone)                                    | Anthropic MCP Python SDK                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Identity**           | High-level, "batteries-included" framework for productivity. | Foundational SDK for MCP protocol compliance.               |
| **Primary Abstraction**     | `FastMCP` server.                                           | `FastMCP` server (v1) and a `low-level` server API.         |
| **Project Structure**       | Encourages a modular, Django-like "app" structure.        | Unopinionated; typically single-file servers in examples.   |
| **Server Composition**      | **Yes** (`mcp.mount()`)                                     | No (relies on external ASGI mounting).                      |
| **Proxying**                | **Yes** (`mcp.as_proxy()`)                                  | No.                                                         |
| **OpenAPI/FastAPI Gen**     | **Yes** (`FastMCP.from_openapi()`)                          | No.                                                         |
| **Settings Management**     | Promotes Django-style `settings.py` file.                   | Internal `Settings` class; no prescribed project pattern.   |
| **Authentication**          | Yes, with various providers.                                | Yes, with a robust OAuth 2.1 implementation.                |
| **CLI Tooling**             | `fastmcp` CLI with project management features.             | `mcp` CLI focused on dev server and Claude installation.    |
| **Ideal Use Case**          | Rapidly building production-ready, modular MCP applications. | Building custom MCP implementations or simple, single-file tools. |

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Philosophy and Goals

-   **FastMCP 2.0**: Aims to be a comprehensive, high-level framework that prioritizes developer experience and productivity. It builds on the core MCP protocol to provide a "batteries-included" experience, much like Django does for web development. Its features are geared towards building complex, production-ready applications quickly.
-   **Anthropic MCP SDK**: Aims to be the official, compliant implementation of the MCP specification. It provides the fundamental building blocks for working with the protocol but is less opinionated about how those blocks should be assembled. Its primary goal is to provide a solid foundation for the MCP ecosystem.

### 2. Architecture and Design

-   **Project Structure**: FastMCP 2.0's design, as shown in its examples, naturally leads to a Django-like project structure. The ability to `mount` servers encourages the separation of concerns into different "apps". The Anthropic SDK, by contrast, does not have this feature, and its examples are mostly self-contained scripts.
-   **Server Composition**: This is a key differentiator. FastMCP 2.0's `mcp.mount()` allows for the creation of a single, unified MCP server from multiple smaller servers. This is a powerful feature for building large, modular applications and is a direct parallel to Django's `include()` for URLs. The Anthropic SDK can only achieve a similar result at the ASGI level, which is less integrated.

### 3. Features and Capabilities

-   **Core Features**: Both frameworks provide a solid implementation of the core MCP features (tools, resources, prompts).
-   **Advanced Features**: FastMCP 2.0 has a clear advantage in its advanced, productivity-oriented features:
    -   **Proxying**: A built-in feature that is absent in the Anthropic SDK.
    -   **Code Generation**: The ability to generate an MCP server from an OpenAPI spec or a FastAPI app is a unique and powerful feature of FastMCP 2.0.
-   **Authentication**: Both frameworks have authentication, but the Anthropic SDK's implementation seems to be more focused on the formal OAuth 2.1 specification, acting as a Resource Server.

### 4. Developer Experience

-   **API**: For the high-level `FastMCP` API, the developer experience is very similar in both frameworks, as they share a common origin (FastMCP 1.0). Both use a clean, decorator-based approach.
-   **Configuration**: FastMCP 2.0's promotion of a Django-like `settings.py` file provides a more structured and familiar configuration experience for developers coming from a Django background.
-   **Tooling**: Both have useful CLI tools, but the `fastmcp` tool seems more geared towards project management, while the `mcp` tool is more focused on running and installing simple servers.

## Conclusion for fjango Integration

**FastMCP 2.0 is the clear choice for integration with fjango.**

Its design philosophy, architectural patterns, and feature set are all strongly aligned with the goals of the fjango project. The Django-like project structure, server composition (`mount`), and focus on developer productivity make it a natural fit. By adopting FastMCP 2.0, fjango can provide a seamless and familiar experience for Django developers who want to build modern, async applications with MCP capabilities.

The Anthropic MCP SDK, while a solid and important piece of the MCP ecosystem, is too low-level and unopinionated for the needs of fjango. It would require fjango to reinvent many of the features that FastMCP 2.0 already provides.
