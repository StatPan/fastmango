# Consolidated Analysis for FastMango

This document synthesizes the vision, roadmap, and technical foundation for the FastMango framework. It consolidates information from multiple analysis documents to provide a single source of truth for strategic planning and feature development.

## 1. Core Vision: The "AI-First" Web Framework

*(Source: `docs/PROJECT_VISION.md`)*

**FastMango** is an **AI-first web framework** that combines FastAPI's modern performance, FastMCP's AI tooling capabilities, and Django's high-productivity patterns into a unified development experience.

The core philosophy is to bridge the gap between traditional web development and the emerging world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Model-Centric Programming (MCP). It aims to provide a seamless environment where developers can build modern web applications that have AI features not as an afterthought, but as a core, integrated component.

## 2. Development Roadmap

*(Source: `docs/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`)*

The development is planned in several phases to incrementally build towards the full vision.

### Phase 1: Foundational Core (Q3 2024)
- **Objective:** Establish the basic framework and developer experience.
- **Key Deliverables:**
    - **Unified `MangoApp`:** A core application class that integrates FastAPI and FastMCP lifecycles.
    - **Basic CLI:** `fastmango new` for project generation and `fastmango run` for starting the development server.
    - **Core Dependency Integration:** `uv`, `Typer`, `FastAPI`, `FastMCP`.
- **Success Criteria:** A developer can generate a new, working FastMango project and run it.

### Phase 2: Django-like Patterns (Q4 2024)
- **Objective:** Enhance productivity by incorporating proven patterns from Django.
- **Key Deliverables:**
    - **Database Integration:** Pre-configured `Tortoise-ORM` with `Aerich` for migrations.
    - **Settings Management:** Django-style settings configuration.
    - **Component Scaffolding:** CLI commands like `fastmango new-tool` or `fastmango new-app`.
- **Success Criteria:** Developers can rapidly build database-backed applications with a familiar, structured workflow.

### Phase 3 & Beyond: Advanced AI & Web Features
- **Objective:** Deepen the integration between web and AI functionalities.
- **Potential Features:**
    - **Unified Auth:** A single authentication system for both web (UI) and AI (tool) endpoints.
    - **Admin Panel:** A Django-like admin interface for managing models and application state.
    - **Real-time Components:** Integration with WebSockets for interactive, real-time AI experiences.

## 3. Foundational Technology: FastMCP Analysis

This section analyzes FastMCP 2.0, the underlying engine for FastMango's AI capabilities.

### 3.1. Core Philosophy and Strengths

*(Source: `docs/analysis/FASTMCP_2_ANALYSIS.md`)*

FastMCP 2.0 provides the "batteries-included" foundation for building AI agent servers, which FastMango directly leverages.

- **Declarative & Composable:** Built around `@mcp.server` objects, allowing modular and reusable components.
- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Handles complex tasks like auth, configuration, and schema generation out-of-the-box.
- **Integrated Environment (`uv`):** Simplifies dependency management and ensures reproducible builds.
- **Centralized Configuration (`fastmcp.json`):** Manages complex, multi-server applications from a single file.
- **Powerful Primitives:**
    - `@mcp.tool`: For defining agent-usable tools with automatic schema generation.
    - `@mcp.resource`: For providing data and files to agents (RAG).
    - `@mcp.auth`: For declarative, provider-based authentication.

### 3.2. How FastMCP Solves Historical Pain Points

*(Source: `docs/analysis/FASTMCP_PAIN_POINTS_ANALYSIS.md`)*

FastMCP 2.0 was designed to solve specific problems that are critical for building robust AI systems. FastMango inherits these solutions.

| Pain Point | Previous Issue | FastMCP 2.0 Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Configuration** | Scattered, imperative config files | Centralized, declarative `fastmcp.json` |
| **Authentication** | Verbose, manual, and error-prone setup | Simple, declarative auth providers |
| **Environments** | Inconsistent developer environments | `uv` integration for locked, reproducible environments |
| **Code Style** | Verbose, imperative code | Declarative, composable `@mcp.server` pattern |
| **RAG/Resources**| Required custom endpoints for data | Unified `@mcp.resource` for files and functions |

## 4. Framework Positioning and Comparison

*(Source: `docs/analysis/FRAMEWORK_COMPARISON.md`)*

Understanding where FastMango fits requires comparing its influences.

| Feature | FastAPI | Django | FastMCP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Use Case** | General-purpose async web APIs | Traditional monolithic web applications | AI Agent & Tool Servers |
| **Style** | Unopinionated, flexible, "micro" | Opinionated, "batteries-included", monolithic | Opinionated, "batteries-included", modular |
| **Core Abstraction** | `APIRouter` | `Project`/`App` | `Server`/`Tool` |
| **Authentication** | User-defined libraries | Built-in sessions/users | Built-in auth providers |
| **Scaffolding** | Minimal | Built-in (`startproject`) | Core to its purpose |

### **Where FastMango Fits In**

**FastMango is a new category that synthesizes the best of all three:**

- It inherits the **performance and web API standards** from **FastAPI**.
- It adopts the **high-productivity patterns, project structure, and "batteries-included" feel** from **Django**.
- It is powered by the **specialized AI agent and tool-serving capabilities** of **FastMCP**.

FastMango is for the developer who wants to build a modern, database-driven web application but also needs to seamlessly integrate powerful AI tools and agents without managing two separate frameworks. It aims to be the **"Django for the AI era."**
